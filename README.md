# Titanic_Survival_Prediction

The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as their age, gender, ticket class, and more, with a focus on the Logistic Regression model for classification.

## Project Workflow
### 1.Data Preprocessing:
* Loading the dataset
* Handling missing values
* Encoding categorical variables
### 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Visualizing the relationship between features and survival
 ### Model Training and Evaluation:
* Training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest
* Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score
  ### Predictions:
* Generating survival predictions on the test set

  ## Run the Notebook
* Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
* Ensure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies.
* Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
* Follow the cells step-by-step to execute the workflow.
